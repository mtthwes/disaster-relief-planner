# 🚀 HOW TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB - Disaster Relief Planner

## What You Have

Complete repository structure for your disaster relief logistics project:

```
disaster-relief-planner/
├── README.md                      ← Professional documentation with algorithm explanations
├── DisasterPlanner.java           ← Main application logic
├── Graph.java                     ← Graph data structure with Floyd-Warshall, BFS
├── .gitignore                     ← Tells Git what NOT to upload
└── sample_data/
    └── road.csv                   ← Test network (Western US cities)
```

## 📤 UPLOAD STEPS (Same as Last Time)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click **+** (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `disaster-relief-planner`
   - **Description:** `Graph algorithms for disaster logistics: set cover, Floyd-Warshall, TSP - Temple CIS 2168`
   - **Public** ✅
   - **Do NOT check** "Add a README" ❌
4. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Upload Files

On the next page:
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"** link
2. **Drag and drop ALL files** from the `disaster-relief-planner` folder:
   - `README.md`
   - `DisasterPlanner.java`
   - `Graph.java`
   - `.gitignore`
   - The `sample_data` folder (with road.csv inside)
3. At the bottom, commit message: `Initial commit: Disaster relief logistics system`
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

---

### Step 3: Verify Upload

Your repo should now show:
- ✅ README.md (with nice algorithm explanations)
- ✅ DisasterPlanner.java
- ✅ Graph.java
- ✅ .gitignore
- ✅ sample_data/road.csv

**Repo URL:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/disaster-relief-planner
```

---

## 🎯 After Upload: Pin This Repo Too

1. Go to your profile: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME`
2. Click **"Customize your pins"**
3. Check **both** repos:
   - ✅ `doctor-patient-scheduler`
   - ✅ `disaster-relief-planner`
4. Click **"Save pins"**

---

## 💡 Why This Repo is Impressive

This project demonstrates:
- **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** (O(n³) dynamic programming)
- **NP-hard problem solving** (Set Cover, TSP)
- **Graph theory fundamentals** (BFS, shortest paths, connectivity)
- **Real-world logistics modeling** (directly relevant to GSK's supply chain)

When GSK recruiters see you've implemented Floyd-Warshall from scratch, they know you understand serious algorithms.
